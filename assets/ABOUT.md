                            ABOUT — KAKEIBO (家計簿)

Kakeibo (家計簿) is a Japanese concept of tracking personal expenses.

The literal meaning is:

- **家 (ka)** — home  
- **計 (kei)** — to measure / calculate  
- **簿 (bo)** — ledger / book  

Together: **“household financial ledger.”**

Kakeibo is not about restricting spending.
It is about *seeing clearly*.

> When money becomes visible, decisions become simple.

Why this project exists

Most expense-tracker apps:

- store financial data in their cloud,
- build behavioral profiles from spending patterns,
- use analytics to influence user decisions,
- require subscriptions for basic features.

I do not want that.

I want a finance tool that I **control**,  
where my data stays on **my machine or my server**,  
not in someone else’s database.

Core principles

**Simplicity**  
Only what is needed. No feature overload.

**Local-first**  
The data belongs to the user — not to a company.

**Incremental improvement**  
Build → use → refine.  
Rewrite parts when needed.

**Clarity over motivation**  
No dopamine loops. No gamification.

> The goal is awareness, not reward.

Development philosophy

The project evolves together with my skills:

- start small (Flask + SQLite),
- refactor as understanding grows,
- change architecture only when needed.

Nothing here is “final”.
The code, structure, and README will change with the project.
